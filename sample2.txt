Lyrics
En garde, I'll let you try my Wu Tang style
I'd like to try your Wu Tang style, let's begin, then
Shaolin shadowboxing and the Wu Tang sword style
If what you say is true, the Shaolin and the Wu Tang could be dangerous (yeah, yeah)
Do you think your Wu Tang sword can defeat me? (Ayo, ayo)
Ayo, Wu-Tang forever
Who rhyme better?
We too clever, the boom bap's back, harder than ever
R.I.P. O.D.B
Comin' through like Killa Bee
Ever since I heard Enter the 36 in '93
You cannot defeat my Wu-Tang style, I leave 'em all dismembered
Fuck a mumble rap, that shit won't never be remembered
Not even a contender, no, pretender, best surrender
My agenda is killin' shit, they feelin' this (Sinatra)
Yeah, we live and thorough
Assassinatin' every single muthafuckin' borough
From Staten to Brooklyn to Queens, the Bronx and Harlem, all the way to Maryland
Yeah, we comin' for all of 'em
Bobby Tarantino to the Digital
My shit is pivotal
Smokin' chronic, no medicinal
Who you know assemble the Clan like Voltron?
The one and only Logic, the God, the don, I'm gone
Ayo, Logic, what up?
We gon' let these muthafuckas try this Wu-Tang style
Yo, yo, yo, yo, kaboom!
Guess who stepped in the room?
It's Ghostface, gold plates, old truths, more K
'Telligent brothers with nine hoods, movin' snowflakes
Guillotine your head, last scene in the showcase
Push weight, this Colgate
Tre-eights and old gates
Exfoliate those we most hate, we don't associate
We wear robes that you can't even pronounce-iate
We eat foods where you can't even pronounce you ate
Cribs where the floor just rises up and rotates
Locations low-key, can't even locate
Twin nina sisters with the beam, we all soulmates
Tea makin' us so much cream, we bought gold plates
Yo, mountains of haze in the crib of my blades
It gets messy underneath the dresser, the gauge
Five-seven MB, yo, metallic green
Seats is piped off
Seize them old tracks, unite through 'em
The kitchen is my palace, get your dance on
While we just levitate with trees, get your branch on
I'm known to wile out, put the cams on
Jewels down, the sets dip, my gems got grams on
A specialist when I'm bakin'
Rhymes be comin' out, we makin'
We challengin' these chumps for lumps
Here's the statement: stop hatin'
The crew is all about gettin' this cake in
You know about me, you relatin'
The enigma, the stigmas that the RZA and the GZA
Both lyrical prolific, fixtures of rap scriptures
Mixtures of hipsters, weed smokers and beer drinkers
Prince and the Pauper, spiritual clear-thinkers
Cake in the oven, Superbad like McLovin
Huggin' all four boroughs
Puffin' herb with my cousin
Academically speaking, rap vocabulary's weakenin'
I felt it comin' like the Weeknd when these starboys start tweakin'
Sporadic pill-poppin' of OxyContin
Ill-gotten sexual intercourse make shorty wop feel rotten
The travesty-tapestry of microphone mastery has been refuted
Diluted, broken down to a catastrophe
But cats still get the trophy
Hit y'all with their "Okie-dokie"
Burt Reynolds, Bandit, goddammit
Where the fuck is Smokey Bear when you need one
I got a light-beam gun
I'll blast a hole in your chest that you can't bleed from
But you'll die through iniquity, plus stupidity of that trickery
My verse got it hot up in here, not the humidity
You can never get rid of me, step back and consider me
Wu Killa Bee, but I'm not big on bigotry
Old-school on this track, I feel invincible
This new school ain't really got rules and lacks the principles
Got mo' clowns than the Motown, they puttin' critical
The gun smokey, Robinson, you need a Miracle
Go back, homie, back when rappers used to be lyrical
When nine out of ten of his friends used to be criminals
The stats, homie, all these killas usin' subliminals
Y'all don't even smile in your pictures, you dudes is miserable
We're the unpredictable, torture over your physical
Drop a bar, used to pour water over the cereal
Another bar, reppin' my squad, not individual
But one Nation under God, that's indivisible
My time critical, hands-off from digital
Me and my lady bark, back when the Planets was Digable
I'm cool like that, my cash rule like that
I'm classic, Patti LaBelle, Voulez Vous like that, come on
It's only Logic, we got 'em mobber than the mosh pit
Fifth Brother, INS hotter than the tropics
The hot shit I drop quick
Major player, watch my stock lift
Razor-blade sharpness regardless to whom or what
Sound boy, turn that music up
Naysayer, you ain't even got a clue what's up
Deadly melody, the sickness, the remedy
Everything circulate back around eventually
Witty, unpredictable, talent all-natural
Gain, Wu-Tang pumpin' through your veins
Twenty-five years, still more of the same
The flow like water with the boilin' flame
INS, your highness, they callin' my name
Boy, I wet the scene similar to fallin' rain
In our own lane, y'all soundin' all the same
Tell 'em Wu-Tang is on your brain
Survival of the fittest in cold days with no money
They don't want me with stacks, they better take it from me
You know the currency gone soon as you break a twenty
So I ain't down if you ain't talkin that band language
Dear Lord, I'm tryna buy me a train with it
An airplane, see me flyin' to Spain with it
But money don't make me, and I ain't gonna change with it
I'm in the hood, lookin' good, the way I came with it
Do it for the Cs, they understood the game with it
We gave birth when we understood the pain with it
When we create wars, everybody is a gangbanger
We killin' each other, but we all got the same anger
Never go against the grain, homie, that's hateful
Another day in the life for us to be grateful
Spread love, homie, yeah, get a plateful
It's better to stay full, so let's make moves
I know your momma told you that I was a great dude
These dirty-ass cops, they kill and rape you
On some Jason shit, might Crystal in the Lake you
What? What what? They might Crystal in the Lake you
Boom bap blast'll blow your sleeves off
Our Flashback Jacks are somethin' to feed off
Smoke and roast ya, the No.9 Potion
Pull that shit, son, we open the ocean
Who gives a fuck who's snortin' and drinkin' and smokin'
You get killed for jokin', everybody's hopin'
That's another level of emotion
Food stamps niggas doin' grocery
Police wanna grope me, perp walk, then nigga street-talk
We bury niggas in see-saw
I carry the torch where I leave off
I'm givin' bitches somethin' to breathe on
I rip off a shoulder to lean on
It's fair game, it's two in a lane, she took two trains
And none of my rhymes are two and the same
Nigga get cooked on an open flame
I'm a hillbilly, Park Hill-trained
My rhyme starts riots in the mountains
Thirty-six million and countin'
The harder they come, the harder I go
Loosen up my arms, can I get comfortable?
Stay on my tip-toes, old-school
Wu B This is a flip-phone, dude, your slips showin'
Where I come from it stays snowin'
The grammar is raw, I'm slammin' the door
Beez bang bong in your jaw
I hit 'em in the head with the hammer of Thor
Stars and bars, makes me a general
Anything less, makes me a criminal
Gotta dig deep for these roots
G.O.D., shadowbox with the L.O.G.I.C
On the count of three, Wu-Tang
First, master your breathin'
I'm mental ass-whoopin', I'm teachin' when I'm speakin'
I'm a champion from Brooklyn
I'm movin' super-ninjas and Shaolin executioners
Avenger, a righteous defender
Grandmaster from the 36th Chamber
Whole style is mentally strong, the strength of your arms
To hold my microphone you need iron palms
Remain calm, just mellow out
Big wise chief Wu-Tang poison clansman from the east, yeah
Enter a world of a universal mind of one kind
A thick swarm of words that's expressed in one rhyme
Food for thought, impossible sliders with the seasoning
Regardless, I speak logic, clear reasoning
The uncivilized, get the mineral lines, quartz
Self-directed, calculated, controlled thoughts
A point-of-view of the thinkers
Monumental architecture, amazing as the Incas
W.T.C., ah-ha
The faculty
Ain't nothin' goin' on, don't nothin' move
Nobody slide, you might get hurt
En garde, I'll let you try my Wu Tang style
I'd like to try your Wu Tang style, let's begin, then
Shaolin shadowboxing and the Wu Tang sword style
If what you say is true, the Shaolin and the Wu Tang could be dangerous
Do you think your Wu Tang sword can defeat me?
I've been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine
Who can relate?
I've been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine
I don't wanna be alive
I don't wanna be alive
I just wanna die today
I just wanna die
I don't wanna be alive
I don't wanna be alive
I just wanna die
And let me tell you why
All this other shit I'm talkin' 'bout they think they know it
I've been praying for somebody to save me, no one's heroic
And my life don't even matter
I know it, I know it, I know I'm hurting deep down but can't show it
I never had a place to call my own
I never had a home
Ain't nobody callin' my phone
Where you been? Where you at? What's on your mind?
They say every life precious but nobody care about mine
I've been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine
Who can relate?
I've been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine
I want you to be alive
I want you to be alive
You don't gotta die today
You don't gotta die
I want you to be alive
I want you to be alive
You don't gotta die
Now lemme tell you why
It's the very first breath
When your head's been drowning underwater
And it's the lightness in the air
When you're there
Chest to chest with a lover
It's holding on, though the road's long
And seeing light in the darkest things
And when you stare at your reflection
Finally knowing who it is
I know that you'll thank God you did
I know where you been, where you are, where you goin'
I know you're the reason I believe in life
What's the day without a little night?
I'm just tryna shed a little light
It can be hard
It can be so hard
But you gotta live right now
You got everything to give right now
I've been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine
Who can relate?
I've been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine
I finally wanna be alive (finally wanna be alive)
I finally wanna be alive
I don't wanna die today (hey)
I don't wanna die
I finally wanna be alive (finally wanna be alive)
I finally wanna be alive (oh)
I don't wanna die (no, I don't wanna die)
I don't wanna die
(I just wanna live)
(I just wanna live)
Pain don't hurt the same, I know
The lane I travel feels alone
But I'm moving 'til my legs give out
And I see my tears melt in the snow
But I don't wanna cry
I don't wanna cry anymore
I wanna feel alive
I don't even wanna die anymore
Oh I don't wanna
I don't wanna
I don't even wanna die anymore
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, or better known as ADHD
Is a mental disorder that affects an individual's ability to focus
Causing them to move around more frequently
They may also have trouble controlling their impulsive behaviors
One time for them prayin' on my downfall (Yeah)
Two times for the homies in the chow hall (Whoa)
Three times for them hoes on the internet
Shittin' on niggas when they really should get out more
Four times for the days I would hold back (Woo!)
Five times for the bitches who ain't called back (Yeah)
Six times for the kids like me who got ADHD just to (Brap, brap, brap)
Kidnap a nigga like ISIS (Whoa)
Turn a whole world to a crisis (Whoa)
Walk around the city with a ice pick
I been paranoid, usually, I ain't like this (Boop, boop)
Ain't no tellin' how crazy I might get, uh (Woo!)
Beat the police with a nightstick (Boop)
And my whole life, I been lifeless
Now I'm so fly, I'm a motherfuckin' flight risk (Woo! Whoa)
Fuck a couple hoes 'til I pass out (Whoa)
Niggas throwin' stones at my glass house (Whoa)
I remember sleepin' on my dad's couch (Whoa)
Now I got the Bentley, and it's blacked out (Whoa)
Family lookin' at me like a cash cow (Whoa)
Errybody dissin' just to have clout (Whoa)
Thought you had a chance, now you assed out
Nigga, I'm the motherfuckin' man, where you at now? (Whoa)
Fuck it, I'ma hit 'em 'til they jumpin'
I ain't trippin', this is nothin' (Brap, brap, brap)
I been livin' in the dungeon
I done held a couple grudges
Went to hell and got abducted, meet the devil
I'm his cousin, I ain't settlin' for nothin' (Brap, brap, brap)
Got a metal in the truck, I keep a semi when I'm bussin'
Niggas duckin' (Bop)
Even Stevie Wonder couldn't see it comin' (Brrrap, brap, bop)
I ain't judgin', I just want the money, I don't need a budget
I been hungry, I ain't got no oven (Bop, bop, brrrap, brap)
But I got the munchies, nigga
How you gon' move on the front line? (Woo!)
If I don't fuck with you, I just cut ties (Whoa)
My high school teacher said I'd never be shit
Tell that bitch that I turned out just fine (Joyner)
And no, I don't know you for the twelfth time (Woo!)
We do not share the same bloodline (No)
You love to run your mouth like a tough guy
Hope you keep the same energy when it's crunch time (Woo!)
According to the American Psychiatric Association
It affects roughly eight percent of children
And two percent of adults
Commonly believed to only affect boys
Because they are perceived as rowdy and rambunctious
One time for them prayin' on my downfall (Yeah)
Two times for them bitches in the South Shore (Whoa)
Three times for them days on the block
Gettin' chased by the cops like a motherfuckin' outlaw
Four times for them days that were all bad (Woo!)
Five times for the bitches who ain't called back (Yeah)
Six times for the kids like me who got ADHD just to (Brap, brap, brap)
Me and Joyner need a couple hearses (Woo!)
Double homicide, kill the beat and the verses
Everybody livin' on the surface
But we came from the underground, yeah, we deserve it
What's beef?
Beef is when you murder motherfuckers on a beat, kill 'em all, kill 'em all
Nah, nah, what's beef?
Beef is brothers dyin' over shit that never mattered in the first place, lyin' in the street
What's peace?
Peace is when you leave it in the past, let it heal like a cast
When enough time pass, and you blast
Kinda like John Wick, bars like a convict
Fuck around and you don't wanna start shit, woo
Comin' with the hot shit, all they do is talk shit
You could never top it, boy, just stop, stop it
High and drunk, call that HD vision
All these other motherfuckers full of indecision
And I murder with precision all over your television
I'm numero uno, number one and you is just a subdivision
Never listen, we gon' leave them missin'
That's the mission like ISIS (ISIS)
Ain't no time to bicker over who the nicest
It's Logic, it's obvious, just ask the audience
I've come to body this shit (Body this shit)
Yes, it's egregious, I'm Regis
You Kelly, you pussy, you pussy
Don't push me, I'm Louis Vuitton
You at Target with your mom
On the internet still hatin' on my last post (I hate this nigga)
I just sent a steak back at Mastro's, my god
Me and Joyner need a couple hearses (Woo!)
Double homicide, kill the beat and the verses
Everybody livin' on the surface
But we came from the underground, yeah, we deserve it
Yeah, uh, far from the minimum, killin' 'em with no Ritalin
And 5'9" was the middleman to get 'em in the same room
Now we on the same tune, and we still the gang-dum
The illest of lyricists on the same shit
Rattpack, clap back on the gang shit
Do it for the love of rap, not for the fame shit, woo
One time for the Grammy that I never got
Two times for the Garden that I sold out
Three times for the street crimes that I committed
Yeah, I did it, but thank God that I made it out
Four times 'cause I'm a fuckin' bastard
Five times Platinum with my last shit
Six times for the beats and the rhymes
Fuck the heat and the crime
Keep the peace like a waistline, woo
ISIS, ISIS, ISIS, ISIS, ISIS
ISIS, ISIS, ISIS, ISIS, ISIS
ISIS, ISIS, ISIS, ISIS, ISIS
ISIS, ISIS, ISIS
Son, you know why you the greatest alive?
Why, Dad?
Because you came out of my balls, nigga
Hahahaha
Fuck rap, bustin' like an addict with a semi-automatic
Who done had it, and he ready for anybody to buck back
Hold up, catch a vibe, ain't no way in hell we leavin' nobody alive
Leave a suicide note, fuck that
Bobby feelin' villainous, he killin' this
I'm comin' for your man and his lady and even the baby
I'm feelin' like I'm chicka-chicka-chicka Slim Shady with rabies
I'm foamin' at the mouth, ain't nobody takin' me out
Every single rapper in the industry, yeah, they know what I'm about
And I dare you to test me
'Cause not a single one of you motherfuckers impress me
And maybe that's a little bit of an exaggeration, but I'm full of innovation
And I'm tired of all of this high school, "He's cool, he's not" rap shit
Can a single one of you motherfuckers even rap? Shit
No, this ain't a diss to the game, it's a gas to the flame
Nowadays, everybody sound the same, shit's lame
Like a moth to the flame, I'ma reel 'em in and kill 'em
Know you feelin' lyricism when I'm spillin' it, I'm feelin' myself
Yeah, yeah, Bobby Boy, he be feelin' himself
Mass murder like this can't be good for my health
When I rap like this, do I sound like shit?
Well, it don't really matter, 'cause I'm killin' this shit
Yeah, I'm killin' this shit
Oh yeah, oh yeah, I'm killin' this shit
Bobby, how many times you been killin' this shit?
Find another rhyme, goddamn, nigga, shit
Fuck rap, bustin' like an addict with a semi-automatic
Who done had it, and he ready for anybody to buck back
Hold up, catch a vibe, ain't no way in hell we leavin' nobody alive
Leave a suicide note, fuck that
Bobby feelin' villainous, he killin' this
I'm comin' for your man and his lady and even the baby
I'm feelin' like I'm chicka-chicka-chicka-chicka-chicka-chicka-chicka-chicka-chicka Slim Shady
There's nowhere to hide, we call this shit genocide
Hit 'em with that (doot, doot, doot) and they die
We gon' leave 'em crucified, we call this shit genocide
I got bitches, I got hoes, I got rare designer clothes
No, we ain't fuckin' with that
Yeah, there's a time and a place, but if you ain't comin' with the illest of raps
Callin' yourself the greatest alive
Then you don't deserve to do that
No, no, oh no, no, please do not do that
You gon' get smacked, you gon' make Bobby attack
You gon' make Bobby Boy snap
You gon' make Bobby Boy snap (Bobby Boy!)
Fuck rap, bustin' like an addict with a semi-automatic
Who done had it, and he ready for anybody to buck back
Hold up, catch a vibe, ain't no way in hell we leavin' nobody alive
Leave a suicide note, fuck that
Bobby feelin' villainous, he killin' this
I'm comin' for your man and his lady and even the baby
I'm feelin' like I'm chicka-chicka-chicka-chicka-chicka-chicka-chicka-chicka-chicka Slim Shady
Jigga-jigga-jigga-jigga-jigga like Jay-Z
Jig is up, you fuckers who didn't write anything
Are getting washed now, chicka-chicka-chicka, like bathing
Young Hova, I know hitters like Yankees
Gun toters that pull triggers like crazy
Unloadin', leave you shot up in your Rover
Your body goes limp and slumps over
Like A-Rod in a month lull, but he just homered
Hold up, I said Rover because now your Rover is red
Like Red Rover, so you know what I meant
But I roll over my opponents instead
Makin' dog sounds 'cause I gotta keep breakin' these bars down
I'll go slow for the speds
But when I go (roof) like the doberman said
I still think the (roof) would go over your head (haha)
Beast mode, motherfuckers 'bout to get hit with so many foul lines
You think I'm a free throw
Figured it was about time for people to eat crow
You about to get out-rhymed, how could I be dethroned?
I stay on my toes like the repo, a behemoth in sheep clothes
From the East Coast to the West, I'm the ethos and I'm the G.O.A.T
Who the best? I don't gotta say a fuckin' thing, though, 'cause MC's know
But you don't wanna hear me spit the facts
Your shit is ass like a tailbone
And you're trapped in your cell phone
On my chicken scratch, or my self-loathe
I don't want to fuckin' listen to you spit your rap someone else wrote
Used to get beat up by the big kids
Used to let the big kids steal my big wheel
And I wouldn't do shit but just sit still
Now money's not a big deal
I'm rich, I wipe my ass with six mil'
Big bills like a platypus
A caterpillar's comin' to get the cannabis
I'm lookin' for the smoke but you motherfuckers are scatterin'
Batterin' everything and I've had it with the inadequate
Man, I can see my dick is standin' stiff as a mannequin
And I'm bringin' the bandana back, and the fuckin' headband again
A handkerchief and I'm thinkin' of bringin' the fuckin' fingerless gloves back
And not giving a singular fuck, like fuck rap
I sound like a fuckin' millionaire
With the Derringer with a hair trigger
'Bout to bear hug it, fuckin' terrier, the Ric Flair dripper
Y'all couldn't hold a candle at a prayer vigil
When I vent, they compare me to a fuckin' air duct
I'm about to bare knuckle it, nah, fuck it
I'm gonna go upside their head with a Nantucket, abraca-fuckin'-dabra
The track is the blood, I'm attracted, I'm attackin' it
What? Dracula, fuck that shit
I'm up, back with a thud
Man, stop
Look what I'm plannin', plannin', I'm plannin' to
Do all this while you panickin'
And you're lookin' and starin' at mannequins
And I'm goin' to Fanagan's, tryin' to get up a plan against
All of the blana-kazana-ka-fam-bam-bannigans
While of all the bana-kazanika Hanna in a cabana
You're in a cab
I'm in a cabana and a Janet
I'm in a cabana chantin' all this stand up banter
While you don't got the stamina, you're lackin' the stamina
You're lackin' the stamina while you're divorcin' Harrison Ford
And I'm in a Porsche on the floor boards
While I'm world tourin'
You usin' way too many napkins, papkins, lapkins and chapki
You using ChapStick and napkins while I'm papkin'
Flappin' around like a bapkin'
Flammina babbita playin' a jampkin
Dammit, a can of pa
