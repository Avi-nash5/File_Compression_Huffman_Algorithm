# File Compression Using Huffman's Algorithm
# About
Huffman Algorithm is an efficient way for file Compression and Decompression. This program exactly follows huffman algorithm. It reads frequent characters from input text file and replace it with shorter binary codeword. The original file can be produced again without loosing any bit.

#Usage
Compression:

	./encode <file to compress>
Output file named .spd will be produced. Decompression:

	./decode <file to uncompress>
