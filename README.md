# File Compression Using Huffman's Algorithm
# About
Huffman Algorithm is an efficient way for file Compression and Decompression. This program exactly follows huffman algorithm. It reads frequent characters from input text file and replace it with shorter binary codeword. The original file can be produced again without loosing any bit.

# Usage
## For Compression:
./encode "filename"

An output file with ".avinash" extension will be created.
## For Decompression:
./decode "filename"

An output file named recovered_"filename" with ".txt" extension will be created
